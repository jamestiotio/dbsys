Welcome!

## Labs

Your project consists of four labs. You are _strongly advised_ to start early.

- [Lab 1](lab1.md): due **24/10 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 2](lab2.md): due **7/11 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 3](lab3.md): due **28/11 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 4](lab4.md): due **12/12 11.59pm**.

Each lab is given **15 points**: **12** for passing all the tests, and **3** for the report.

## Important

In addition to the academic integrity policy (as discussed in the lecture), take note that:

- You cannot make your Github repository for the labs public.
- You cannot copy and paste code from other people or any other sources.
- You cannot share your solutions.

## Disclaimer

This database system is only for educational and learning purposes only! It is very simplistic, highly unoptimized, and is definitely not suitable for real-life production use.

## Acknowledgement

The labs are modified from the MIT 6830 course. We thank the MIT staff for the materials.
