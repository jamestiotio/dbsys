Welcome!

## Labs

Your project consists of four labs. You are _strongly advised_ to start early.

- [Lab 1](lab1.md): due **24/10 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 2](lab2.md): due **7/11 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 3](lab3.md): due **28/11 11.59pm**.
- [Lab 4](lab4.md): due **12/12 11.59pm**.

Each lab is given **15 points**: **12** for passing all the tests, and **3** for the report.

## Important

In addition to the academic integrity policy (as discussed in the lecture), take note that:

- You cannot make your Github repository for the labs public.
- You cannot copy and paste code from other people or any other sources.
- You cannot share your solutions.

## Disclaimer

This database system is only for educational and learning purposes only! It is very simplistic, highly unoptimized, and is definitely not suitable for real-life production use.

Future work might include implementing query optimization, as well as rollback and recovery.

For some reason, this entire project made me develop anxiety whenever I run `ant runtest -Dtest=XXX` and `ant runsystest -Dtest=XXX` in any console window. I wonder why. Make of this information what you will.

## Acknowledgement

The labs are modified from the [MIT 6.830 course](http://dsg.csail.mit.edu/6.830/). We thank the MIT staff for the materials.
